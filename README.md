As a Data analyst and scientist, i am versatile in building models that translate data points into business insights using various data analytic and visualization tools. I like to
explore the relationships between numbers, and translate digits and spreadsheets into stories. In the age of big data, these stories become actionable solutions and strategies for businesses, and I take pride in my ability to make data accessible to both executive decision-makers and frontline sales staf.

I am experienced in machine learning, supervised algorithms and use data visualization techniques to present the results. I use SQL, Python, Microsoft PowerBI and Tableau for my data projects and am very good in debugging.
